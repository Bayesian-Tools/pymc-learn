Install pymc-learn
===================

``pymc-learn`` requires a working Python interpreter (2.7 or 3.3+).
It is recommend installing Python and key numerical libraries using the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_,
which has one-click installers available on all major platforms.

Assuming a standard Python environment is installed on your machine
(including pip), ``pymc-learn`` itself can be installed in one line using pip:

You can install ``pymc-learn`` from PyPi using pip as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pymc-learn


Or from source as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-learn/pymc-learn


.. CAUTION::
   ``pymc-learn`` is under heavy development.


This also installs required dependencies including TensorFlow.
For alternative TensorFlow installations (e.g., gpu), please see the
instructions on the main `TensorFlow webpage <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_.
